##Pokemon Test

In which I attempt to recreate a Pokemon Game. I've actually attempted this before, I'm now just redoing it and using Github/Git as version control in case I do something horribly wrong :P

**Changes:**

May 28, 2014

- Initial Commit, and some other stuff. Got the map renderer working but that's pretty much it.
- Nearly trashed the whole repository because I'm such a git noob. Had to revert back to previous commits
